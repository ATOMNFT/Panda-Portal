# 🐼 Panda Portal

This is a **Progressive Web App (PWA)** that allows users to:

- ✅ Scan multiple Ethereum wallets for NFTs from 3 Official PandaMania collections
- ✅ Track the total balance of the Panda Token from the Abstract chain
- ✅ Use offline caching and install the app like a native app
- ✅ Toggle between dark and light mode
- ✅ Switch between tabs for scanning NFTs and checking tokens

## 🔒 Your Safety Matters

This app **does not connect** to your wallet, ask for permissions, or interact with private keys.  
All lookups are done using **public blockchain data**, and your assets remain completely safe.  
You can use it **anonymously and securely**.
